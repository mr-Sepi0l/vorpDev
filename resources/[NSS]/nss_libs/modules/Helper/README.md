# nss_libs - Helper

This directory contains the helper libraries for NSS modules. The helper libraries are used to simplify the development
of NSS modules.

For client and server there are different helper libraries. The client helper is used for client side and the server
helper is used for server side.

* [Client helper](./client/README.md)
* [Server helper](./server/README.md)

__Important:__ Client and server side inherit the shared helper that works for both client and server.

* [Shared helper](./share/README.md)
